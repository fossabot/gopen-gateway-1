# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our application, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please, DO NOT create an Issue reporting the vulnerability. Instead, please send an email directly to us at gabrielcataldo.adm@gmail.com.

We will treat your report as high priority.

## How vulnerabilities are managed

Vulnerability reports are of great importance to us, so we give them the highest priority.

Upon receipt of a report:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and will send you regular updates about our progress.
2. If you correctly identified a vulnerability in our application, we commit to:
    - Validating, responding, and fixing vulnerabilities within a certain time frame.
    - Notifying the person who submitted the bug when it is fixed.
    - Publicly thanking the person who discovered the issue and giving credit for finding it (if you do not want this recognition, we will certainly respect that).

Again, we ask that you do NOT share vulnerabilities publicly, instead, reach out to us via gabrielcataldo.adm@gmail.com.
